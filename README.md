# GraphStream -- Android Viewer

The GraphStream project is a java library that provides an API to model, analyze and visualize graphs and dynamic graphs.

This module contains a Android implementation of the GraphStream Viewer.

Check out the Website <http://www.graphstream-project.org/> for more information.

## UI

This renderer supports almost all of the CSS properties defined in the [GraphStream CSS Reference](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/GraphStream-CSS-Reference_1.0/), however it is still a work in progress. This viewer is intended only at 2D visualization actually.

We are interested in any suggestion to improve this renderer, and your use cases could be of great help for us in developing this project. If you like and use this project, this could be a good contribution.

## Install UI

`gs-ui-android` is a plugin to the `gs-core` main project.

The release comes with a pre-packaged aar file named `gs-ui-android.aar` that contains the GraphStream viewer classes. It depends on the root project `gs-core`.

 For using Graphstream, your project <b>must</b> run with java 8

 Add the .aar in your project following these instructions : https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library.html#AddDependency

 You can download GraphStream on the github releases pages:

- [gs-core](https://github.com/graphstream/gs-core/releases)
- [gs-ui-android](https://github.com/graphstream/gs-ui-android/releases)


Gradle users, you may include `gs-core` and `gs-ui-android` as a dependency to your project using <https://jitpack.io>.
Simply add the `jitpack` repository to the `pom.xml`:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

then, add the `gs-core` and `gs-ui-android` to your dependencies:

```xml
dependencies {
    api 'com.github.graphstream:gs-ui-android:2.0'
    api 'com.github.graphstream:gs-core:2.0'
}
```

You can use any version of `gs-core` and `gs-ui-android` you need, provided they are the same. Simply specify the desired version in the `<version>` tag. The version can be a git tag name (e.g. `2.0`), a commit number, or a branch name followed by `-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. `dev-SNAPSHOT`). More details on the [possible versions on jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#graphstream/gs-core).

## Configure UI

For the convenience of the users, a default Android Fragment (`org.graphstream.ui.android_viewer.util.DefaultFragment`) is provided. The Fragment can be used like so:

```java
public void display(Bundle savedInstanceState, Graph graph, boolean autoLayout) {
    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();

        // find fragment or create him
        fragment = (DefaultFragment) fm.findFragmentByTag("fragment_tag");
        if (null == fragment) {
            fragment = new DefaultFragment();
            fragment.init(graph, autoLayout);
        }

        // Add the fragment in the layout and commit
        FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction() ;
        ft.add(CONTENT_VIEW_ID, fragment).commit();
    }
}
```
